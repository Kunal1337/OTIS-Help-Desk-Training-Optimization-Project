# OTIS Help Desk Training Optimization Project



This project focuses on improving the University of Texas System OTIS Help Desk training through data cleanup, SQL analysis, and a dynamic SharePoint handbook integrated in Microsoft Teams. Redundant data was removed, key training metrics were extracted with SQL queries, and visualizations were built to highlight performance trends. The final deliverable is a centralized, easy-to-access training handbook that streamlines service cataloging and supports continuous optimization of Help Desk processes.
